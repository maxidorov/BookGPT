# BookGPT Privacy Policy

Last updated: February 20, 2026

## 1. Scope
This policy explains how BookGPT collects, uses, and shares personal data when you use the app.

## 2. Data We Process
BookGPT may process:
- text you enter (book queries, chat prompts, onboarding answers),
- generated outputs (character responses, portrait requests),
- subscription status and purchase metadata from Apple/RevenueCat,
- basic technical telemetry (app version, error logs, request timings).

BookGPT does not intentionally collect sensitive personal data unless you provide it in free-text fields.

## 3. How We Use Data
We process data to:
- deliver app features (search, character generation, chat, portrait generation),
- enforce paid access and restore purchases,
- maintain reliability, prevent abuse, and debug failures,
- improve prompt quality and product performance.

## 4. AI/LLM Processing
- User inputs and chat history may be sent to third-party AI providers to generate responses and portraits.
- AI providers may process content according to their own policies and retention settings.
- Do not submit confidential, highly sensitive, or regulated personal data.

## 5. Copyright and Content Handling
- You are responsible for ensuring prompts and usage comply with applicable copyright law.
- BookGPT is designed to generate original outputs, but model outputs can still resemble existing works.
- If you believe content infringes rights, contact us for review and removal handling.

## 6. Purchase Data
- Purchases are processed by Apple.
- We receive entitlement and subscription status through RevenueCat to unlock premium access.
- We do not collect or store full payment card details.

## 7. Data Sharing
We may share data with service providers strictly to operate the app, including:
- AI inference providers,
- subscription infrastructure providers,
- crash/error monitoring providers.

We do not sell personal data.

## 8. Data Retention
- We retain data only as long as needed for service delivery, legal obligations, and security.
- Locally cached book/character data and portrait assets can remain on device until app removal or cache reset.

## 9. Security
We use reasonable technical and organizational safeguards, but no system is perfectly secure.

## 10. Your Rights
Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or restrict processing of personal data. Include your privacy contact channel before release.

## 11. Children
BookGPT is not directed to children under the minimum digital consent age in your jurisdiction.

## 12. International Transfers
Data may be processed in countries different from your own where service providers operate.

## 13. Policy Updates
We may update this policy as the product evolves. Material updates will be reflected by the updated date.

## 14. Contact
Provide your privacy contact email and legal entity details here before release.
